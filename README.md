# wkrw

**wkrw** is a small joke CLI inspired by Mizuki Kawashima (*The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls*).
The name comes from her well-known phrase **「わかるわ」 (Wakaruwa)**, which translates to **"I understand"**.

This command doesn’t do anything serious — it’s meant as a fun little tool to install and play around with.
